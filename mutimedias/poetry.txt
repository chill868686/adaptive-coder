登高
Climbing the Height

杜甫【唐】
DU FU (Tang dynasty)

风急天高猿啸哀，渚清沙白鸟飞回。
The wind so swift, the sky so steep, sad gibbons cry;
Water so clear and sand so white, backward birds fly.

无边落木萧萧下，不尽长江滚滚来。
The boundless forest sheds its leaves shower by shower;
The endless River rolls its waves hour after hour.

万里悲秋常作客，百年多病独登台。
Far from home in autumn, I'm grieved to see my plight;
After my long illness, I climb alone this height.

艰难苦恨繁霜鬓，潦倒新停浊酒杯。
Living in hard times, at my frosted hair I pine;
Pressed by poverty, I give up my cup of wine.
